This webpage is about creating a webpage to include certain elements.
I chose to create this website based on something I love doing in my spare time, sewing.

I can teach the followin:
  1- how to take measurments
  2- use your measurements to draft a pattern: e.g bodice then into a dress 
  3-Make a toile from the pattern (toile=a sample garemnet of the pattern)
  4-make adjustments to the toile
  5-drafte these changes to the pattern and redraft pattern
  6-make the actual garment and complete it
